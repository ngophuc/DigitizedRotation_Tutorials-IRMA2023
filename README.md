# Tutorials for Summer school: <a href=https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/9939/>"Geometry and Data"</a> (Universit√© de Strasbourg - August 2023)
## Practice on the course: <a href=https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/9939/sessions/1440/>Geometric Transformations on Digital Images</a>

This respository contains exercices in Python for the practical works of the course on Geometric Transformations on Digital Images. 

The technical requirements for the code are:
* Python 3.x
* Git client
* OpenCV installed

This tutorial can also be done, only with the online platforms such as:
* <a href=https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/>JupyterLab</a> (no account, no paid plan needed)
* <a href=https://colab.research.google.com/> Google Colab</a> (you just need a Google account, no paid plan needed)

Attention: For the online code, the functions related the interface (cv.namedWindow, cv.imshow, cv.destroyAllWindows, cv.createTrackbar, ...) won't work. 

## Get the code

To get the code, the easiest way is to `clone` the github repository. E.g. with the command-line git client:
  
    git clone https://github.com/ngophuc/DigitizedRotation_Tutorials-IRMA2023.git

(You can also use your favorite GUI git client).

## Third-party libraries

The code uses <a href=https://opencv.org/>OpenCV library</a> of image processing and computer vision.
